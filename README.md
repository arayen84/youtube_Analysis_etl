# Project Goals

Data Ingestion: Develop a mechanism to efficiently collect data from various sources.

Data Lake: Centralize data from diverse sources within a unified repository for storage.

Scalability: Ensure our system is capable of expanding in tandem with the growth in data volume.

Cloud: Opt for cloud services, specifically AWS in this instance, for hosting and managing the system.

Reporting: Construct a comprehensive dashboard for presenting insights and analysis.
